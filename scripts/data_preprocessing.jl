    and receive from receive-poly. In this new reconciliation, the total number of send and send-poly 
    is equal to the total number of receive and receive-poly (S+Sp=R+Rp). Every documented synapse is

Neuron: Name of neuron
Soma Position: Position of cell body along the AP axis of worm body. 0=tip of nose; 1=tail tip.

Span: Length of neuron span. Neurons spanning <25% of worm body (e.g., motor neurons in the ventral cord, 
    neurons with processes confined to the nerve ring and neurons confined in the mid-body) are defined to 
    have short spans (S). All other neurons are defined to have long spans (L).
Ambiguity: If applicable, code for the type of ambiguity. Codes beginning with M denote ambiguity 
    citedin White et al, 1986. Codes beginning with R denote ambiguity found in reconstructions during 
    update of wiring diagram (MB=cell body position ambiguous, MTS=tail synapses ambiguous and/or sparse 
    connections in the tail; MAS=anterior body ambiguous and/or sparse connections in the anterior; MD=dorsal 
    side ambiguous; MAD=anterior and dorsal side ambiguous; MS=neurons with sublateral processes not covered 
    by reconstructions. RDI=dorsal reconstruction incomplete; RDM=dorsal reconstruction completely missing; 
    RVI=ventral reconstruction incomplete.)
TotHead: Total number of synapses in the head including EJ and NMJ.
TotTail: Total number of synapses in the tail including EJ and NMJ.
TotMid: Total number of synapses in the mid-body including EJ and NMJ.
S_Head: Number of “sends” or output synapses in the head, includes send polyadic synapses (see Figure 1) and NMJ.
R_Head: Number of “receives” or input synapses (includes polyadic synapses) in the head.
S_Mid: Number of “sends” or output synapses in the mid-body, includes polyadic synapses and NMJ.
R_Mid: Number of “receives” or input synapses (includes polyadic synapses) in the mid-body.
S_Tail: Number of “sends” or output synapses in the tail, includes polyadic synapses and NMJ.
R_Tail: Number of “receives” or input synapses (includes polyadic synapses) in the tail.

    A=anterior ganglion, B=dorsal ganglion, C=lateral ganglion, D=ventral ganglion, E=retrovesicular ganglion, 
    F=posterolateral ganglion, G=ventral cord neuron group, H=pre-anal ganglion, J=dorsorectal ganglion, 
    K=lumbar ganglion.

Note:  Sum of S_Head and R_Head does not include electrical junctions (EJ), therefore, does not equal TotHead.  Similar is true for mid-body and tail.
