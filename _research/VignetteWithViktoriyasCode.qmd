## Environment construction

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{julia}
using CSV
using ColorSchemes
using Colors
using DataFrames
using DiffEqBase
using DifferentialEquations
using LinearAlgebra
using ModelingToolkit
using Plots
using XLSX
```

## Data uploading and cleaning

The following lines extract the data from different files and stores as a dataframe:

```{julia}
data_connect_phar = CSV.read("RawData/ConexionsPharyngeal.csv", DataFrame)
"""
Sending: Name of sending neuron
Receiving: Name of receiving neuron
Number: Number of synapses between the given neuron pair.
Type: Type of synapse: S: synaptic; G: gap.
"""
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
